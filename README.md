# The-UT-Directory-Crawler
Update: As of now, this project is deceased ðŸ’€ because UT has put a 2FA on UT directory site.
I have plans on getting around that 2FA. I will most likely work on this project again in the future.

[Beta Version]:
A Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup4 library to extract all the available information regarding a UT-affiliated member through the
UT Directory website. The script allows one to extract the information of multiple people at once - just fill in the text file with first and last name of the persons and run the script. The attached CSV file named names_emails.csv will automatically update.
